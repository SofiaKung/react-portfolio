        <p>
          As part of Singapore's Smart Nation Initiative, the nation's public
          data is made available on open data portals for decision makers to
          monitor and gain insights about Singaporeâ€™s social and economic
          trends.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Due to the lack of a proper tool to visualize these data, the public
          is unable to harness the value of these data. To address this issue,
          we created GeViz, an interactive visual analytics dashboard for the
          public and ministries of Singapore to uncover insights on Singapore
          government's procurement spending, with the aim to identify
          procurement needs of Singapore government, spending patterns, as well
          as, relationships between ministries and suppliers.
